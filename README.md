# React Assignment Project

Welcome to my React assignment project! This project was created as a submission for an assignment from Mason. Below you'll find some important information about the project.

## About

This project was built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast frontend build tool for modern web development. It leverages the power of modern JavaScript tooling to provide a lightning-fast development experience.

## Additional Features

- **Dark Mode:** I've implemented a dark mode feature that allows users to switch to a darker color scheme for improved readability. To enable dark mode, simply add the `dark` class to the root element of the application.

## Deviations from Requirements

- **Icon Pack:** Due to constraints regarding access to assets, I've used a different icon pack than the one specified in the original Figma file provided. While the icons may differ, I've ensured that they maintain consistency and functionality within the application.
